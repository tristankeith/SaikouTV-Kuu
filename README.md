## NOTES
- Only intended to fix sources since I want to watch on TV seamlessly. I have subscriptions on various streaming sites but sometimes what I want to watch isn't there so SaikouTV comes in handy.

## RELEASE
- I don't release apk. If you want this version, Build it yourself.
- or Download the latest release from KemuriXD: <a href="https://github.com/kemuriXD/SaikouTV/releases"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/downloads/kemuriXD/SaikouTV/total?color=%233DDC84&logo=android&logoColor=%23fff&style=for-the-badge"></a>
